            <p>
                I'm Miguel, a recent graduate from <i>California State University, Long Beach</i>, and actively looking for ways to put my knowledge to the test in the real world.<br>
                <br> Mainly, I focus on <b>Embedded Systems</b> but have also done some <b>Software Development</b>. Some languages I have used for embedded projects are C language along with some Python. I also have some 
                experience using Java and C++. I enjoy turning ideas into personal projects using topics from school and with real life inspiration. 
                <br>
                <br> Currently I am still trying to find an opportunity to take everything I have learned and get my career as an engineer going.
                In the mean time, I use whatever free time I have to go out with friends, learn new coding languages, play video games, and exercise.
                I also use some time to think of my next project to work on. <br>
                <br>
                In this website, you will find everything I have built, coded, and learned along the way in both school and in my spare time.
            </p>
